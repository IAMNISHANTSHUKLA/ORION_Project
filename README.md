| Gateway     | Card/ACH/Wire integrations         |
| Risk        | Real-time fraud detection          |
| Settlement  | Automated reconciliation           |
| Audit       | Immutable compliance trails        |
| Ops         | Dashboard & intervention tools     |
| MQ / LB     | Custom queue & load balancer       |
